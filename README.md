# Nix Home Manager Dotfiles

This is my [Nix](https://nixos.org/) [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) repository using a [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

I run this over a [Fedora Atomic Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/), providing an immutable base for my system.

## Bootstrapping a new system

* Install an atomic desktop on your system. In my case, I prefer the [sway edition](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/sway/).
* Install the Nix package manager on the system:

```bash
$ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) â€“daemon
```

* Add `nixpkgs` and `home-manager` channels:

```bash
$ nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
$ nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
$ nix-channel --update
```

* Install `home-manager`:

```bash
$ nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
```

* Clone this repository, then run the following command from within the `dotfiles` directory:

```bash
$ home-manager switch --flake .
```

This will publish all the dotfiles to the `/nix` store and place symlinks to these files in your home directory.
If the files already exist, you will be asked to remove them, as home-manager will not overwrite them.
